# Dynamic-Traffic-Signal

Dynamic Traffic System - This project is based on real time detection of traffic congestion using Python. The system contains raspberry-pi 3B, camera and LED traffic modules. Uses Haar Cascade / Yolo Algorithm to detect and count vehicles. GPIO pins used to control traffic module.

Important Libraries used:
1. OpenCV - Used to detect and capture frames from the camera module.
2. Turtle - For graphical representation of 4 way traffic signal system.
